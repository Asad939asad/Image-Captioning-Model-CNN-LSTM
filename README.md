Here's a detailed description of the code:

---

## **Description of the Code**

### **1. Load Libraries**  
The code starts by importing the necessary libraries for data handling, image processing, model building, and evaluation:  
- **matplotlib, pandas, numpy** ‚Äì For data manipulation and visualization.  
- **pickle** ‚Äì For saving and loading processed data.  
- **os** ‚Äì For file and directory handling.  
- **tensorflow.keras and keras** ‚Äì For defining the CNN-LSTM model and training it.  
- **random** ‚Äì For shuffling and sampling data.  
- **nltk** ‚Äì For calculating BLEU scores.  

---

### **2. Load Data**  
The Flickr8k dataset is loaded from the specified directory:  
- **Images** ‚Äì Loaded from the `Images` directory.  
- **Captions** ‚Äì Loaded from the `Flickr8k.token.txt` file.  
- **Train, Test, and Validation Sets** ‚Äì Loaded from the respective files.  

---

### **3. Preprocessing**  
#### **Image Preprocessing**  
- Resizes the input images to `(224, 224, 3)` to make them compatible with ResNet-50.  
- Uses the **ResNet-50** model (without the final classification layer) to extract image features.  
- The extracted features are stored in a dictionary using `pickle` for faster access.  

**Code Example:**  
```python
def preprocessing(img_path):
    im = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224,224,3))
    im = image.img_to_array(im)
    im = np.expand_dims(im, axis=0)
    return im
```

---

#### **Text Preprocessing**  
- Captions are stored in a dictionary, with the image ID as the key and associated captions as the values.  
- The captions are tokenized into individual words.  
- A vocabulary is created, and each word is mapped to an index.  
- Padding is applied to ensure consistent sequence lengths.  

**Code Example:**  
```python
tokens = {}
for ix in range(len(captions)-1):
    temp = captions[ix].split("#")
    if temp[0] in tokens:
        tokens[temp[0]].append(temp[1][2:])
    else:
        tokens[temp[0]] = [temp[1][2:]]
```

---

### **4. Vectorization and Sequence Preparation**  
- Words are mapped to numerical indices using the created vocabulary.  
- Input sequences and target words are generated.  
- Sequences are padded to a fixed length using `sequence.pad_sequences`.  
- One-hot encoding is applied to target words.  

**Code Example:**  
```python
next_words_1hot = np.zeros([len(next_words), vocab_size], dtype=np.bool)
for i, next_word in enumerate(next_words):
    next_words_1hot[i, next_word] = 1
```

---

### **5. Model Architecture**
#### **Encoder (CNN)**  
- A pre-trained **ResNet-50** model (excluding the final classification layer) is used as the encoder.  
- The extracted features are processed through:  
  - **Dense Layer** ‚Äì To reduce dimensionality.  
  - **Batch Normalization** ‚Äì For stability during training.  
  - **Dropout** ‚Äì To prevent overfitting.  
  - **RepeatVector** ‚Äì To adjust the output shape to match the LSTM input.  

**Code Example:**  
```python
image_model = Sequential([
    Dense(embedding_size, input_shape=(2048,), activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.01)),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.3),
    RepeatVector(max_len)
])
```

---

#### **Decoder (LSTM)**  
- The decoder processes tokenized caption sequences.  
- It uses:  
  - **Embedding Layer** ‚Äì Converts input words into dense vectors.  
  - **LSTM Layers** ‚Äì Process the sequence and generate context.  
  - **Batch Normalization** ‚Äì For training stability.  
  - **TimeDistributed Layer** ‚Äì To output predictions at each time step.  

**Code Example:**  
```python
language_model = Sequential([
    Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_size, input_length=max_len),
    LSTM(256, return_sequences=True, dropout=0.3, recurrent_dropout=0.3),
    BatchNormalization(),
    LSTM(128, return_sequences=True, dropout=0.3, recurrent_dropout=0.3),
    BatchNormalization(),
    TimeDistributed(Dense(embedding_size, activation='relu'))
])
```

---

#### **Combined Model**  
- The CNN and LSTM outputs are concatenated.  
- Two LSTM layers are used to process the combined input.  
- A dense layer with softmax activation predicts the next word.  

**Code Example:**  
```python
conca = Concatenate()([image_model.output, language_model.output])
x = LSTM(128, return_sequences=True)(conca)
x = LSTM(512, return_sequences=False)(x)
x = Dense(vocab_size)(x)
out = Activation('softmax')(x)
```

---

### **6. Training**  
- The model is compiled using **categorical cross-entropy** loss and **RMSprop** optimizer.  
- The model is trained using the training data for **200 epochs** with a batch size of **512**.  
- Training loss and accuracy are plotted.  

**Code Example:**  
```python
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='RMSprop', metrics=['accuracy'])
hist = model.fit([images, captions], next_words, batch_size=512, epochs=200)
```

---

### **7. Predictions**  
- Captions are generated using a greedy search strategy.  
- The next word is predicted using `argmax`.  
- Prediction stops when the `<end>` token is generated or the maximum length is reached.  

**Code Example:**  
```python
def predict_captions(image):
    start_word = ["<start>"]
    while True:
        par_caps = [word_2_indices[i] for i in start_word]
        par_caps = sequence.pad_sequences([par_caps], maxlen=max_len, padding='post')
        preds = model.predict([np.array([image]), np.array(par_caps)])
        word_pred = indices_2_word[np.argmax(preds[0])]
        start_word.append(word_pred)

        if word_pred == "<end>" or len(start_word) > max_len:
            break

    return ' '.join(start_word[1:-1])
```

---

### **8. BLEU Score Evaluation**  
- BLEU score is calculated using the `nltk` library.  
- BLEU score measures how well the generated captions match the reference captions.  
- The score is computed for a sample of 100 images to reduce computation time.  

**Code Example:**  
```python
from nltk.translate.bleu_score import sentence_bleu

def evaluate_bleu_score(model, dataset, images, num_samples=100):
    total_bleu_score = 0.0
    for ix in range(num_samples):
        true_caption = dataset[ix, 1].split()
        image = images[ix]
        predicted_caption = generate_caption(image).split()
        score = sentence_bleu([true_caption], predicted_caption)
        total_bleu_score += score
    avg_bleu_score = total_bleu_score / num_samples
    return avg_bleu_score

bleu_score = evaluate_bleu_score(model, ds, images, num_samples=100)
print(f"Average BLEU Score: {bleu_score:.4f}")
```
